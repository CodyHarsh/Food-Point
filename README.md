# Food-Point
This is the food ordering website. In this we have used these technologies:
1. PHP
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. My Sql
5. HTML
###### Software needed for this:
1. xampp - For database
2. IDE Or Text - Editor for coding(I have used - Visual studio Code).

Here are two folder you have to paste this folder in: 
C: >> xampp >> htdocs

So These are the databases name which are used in the food ordering system.
1. login_register_pure_coding -> This database name is used for taking login information and collecting data for register user.
2. shopping-cart OR cart_system-> This database name is used for order items, products adding or deleting and cart in which we can see which product is currently in cart.

# cart_system
This is shopping-cart database.
